<h1>Using CSS variables &amp; transforms for tooltips that track the mouse.</h1>
<p>This page demonstrates the use of CSS Variables in creating tool-tips.  A feature of this approach is minimizing both additional page content and additional processing.</p>

<p data-tip="This is a tooltip.">Each paragraph that looks like this has a tooltip.</p>

<p data-tip="Tooltips are just text.">A single element is used to present the tooltip content.  This element is moved relative to the mouse pointer using a CSS3 transformation.  The transformation uses CSS variables that are initialised to (0,0) using css variables.  </p>

<p data-tip="This is also a tooltip">Please hover over me <span data-tip="Oh I say!">noticing that this text</span> in brackets has a different tooltip.</p>
